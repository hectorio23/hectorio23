# WELCOME TO MY REPOSITORY

## Hello, I'm *Adán aka kernelripper*! 👋
I'm a passionate software developer with a focus on creatively solving problems. My experience spans from intermediate to advanced levels, and I enjoy tackling challenges that allow me to enhance my programming skills.

💻 In my toolbox, you'll find:

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, C++, C#, HTML Senior, CSS, SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQLite).
- **Problem Solving**: I love addressing practical problems and devising efficient solutions.
- **User Interaction**: I've worked on projects involving smooth user interaction, handling inputs intuitively.
- **Experienced Linux Power User**: I have a butally insane  experience with Linux as my primary operating system, used distros like Arch Linux and Gentoo for a long time (years and counting...).
- **Script Kiddie**: I'am a beginner in this subject, but soon I will become a Professional Pentester in the future.

Thanks for visiting my profile! 🚀
If you have any suggestions, please let me know.
